        <p class="first-last">
          Congratulations, you're getting a puppy! Many
          of our friends have asked us for advice on raising
          a dog, so we've decided to consolidate the highlights here. We've
          learned a lot from Watson, and are delighted to share. That's him
          on the day we first got him!<br><br>
          Before we ever brought Watson home, however, we <b>did our homework</b>. Two
          books we found particularly useful are
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Perfect-Dog-Puppyhood/dp/0307461300/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">
            How To Raise The Perfect Dog</a>
          and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cesars-Rules-Your-Train-Well-Behaved/dp/0307716872/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">
            Cesar's Rules</a>
          by Cesar Millan. Both are a very easy read. They do a good job not only
          providing techniques for taking good care of your pup, but also explaining
          the principles behind training techniques. You'll feel much more prepared
          to be a <b>great dog parent</b> after reading these books!<br><br>
          If you're anything like we are, you'll soon find yourself buying way
          too much stuff for your new "child." Trust us, this is normal. A couple
          of essentials are particularly important to <b>get beforehand</b>. For
          crate training, find a comfortable, size appropraite travel crate, like
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002YHWAU/ref=twister_B01DYNWP7A?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1">
            this one</a>.
          You'll read all about the importance of crate training in Cesar's books,
          but suffice to say that it's incredibly helpful for potty training,
          and being able to travel with your pup later. While you're at it, pick up
          a pen like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MidWest-Foldable-Exercise-Pen-Playpen/dp/B000H8YTJI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1482599721&sr=8-2&keywords=dog+pen">
            this</a>
          to set up in your home. Puppies get overwhelmed by open spaces, so
          a smaller space will help the little one feel safe.

        <h2 class="middle">Getting Through the Teenage Years</h2>
        <p class="middle">
          Once you and your little bud have gotten through early
          puppyhood together, it's time for doggy teenage years. Just like human
          teenage years, these are formative, exciting, and challenging. From 6 months
          until about 3 years old, the name of the game will be <b>patience</b>
          and <b>consistency</b>.<br><br>
          One of the most important things for your pup to work on early is
          <b>socialization</b>. You should begin exposing them to as many different
          people as possible (kids, adults, men, women, etc), as soon as possible.
          Keep this up from puppyhood to the teenage years to help raise a dog that
          is friendly to all humans it meets! Just be careful to limit squealing
          and excitement. Although this can be a tough one, especially with
          an adorable puppy, people tend to understand when you ask them to act
          calmly so your pup can learn to be calm too.<br><br>
          A great way to learn socialization and <b>obedience</b> is by enrolling
          in puppy school. <a href="https://www.siriuspup.com/">Sirius Dog Training</a>
          worked well for us - check them out if you're in the Bay Area. Developing
          a training routine will engage your dog and help him/her develop a strong
          bond with you. Of course, the most important part will be to keep up the
          training routine you learn in puppy school in the months and years afterward.
          This is all part of the consistency and structure that will help your dog
          feel balanced and be well behaved.

        <p class="first-last">
          Time flies! Before you know it, the confused little fluff ball you once
          brought home will turn into a proud, loyal companion. People often tell
          us that Watson is the perfect dog. Of course, the truth is, he is just the
          perfect dog <b>for us</b>. If you put in the time and discipline into
          the early months and years, you'll also raise the best dog you could ever
          imagine.<br><br>
          So, what now? Is your job done? Well, sort of. The hardest part is over.
          But now, it's time to make sure both you and your dog get the most out
          of your relationship. Make time each day to <b>bond</b> with your dog by
          taking him/her on walks (at least one 45-60min walk per day). Get to know
          the best doggie play spots in your area, like parks, hiking trails, or beaches.

            Crissy Field</a> are two of our favorites.
          Keep challenging your bud through continued training. This can be as simple
          as letting him/her earn yummy treats by going through the basics (sit, stay, leave-it),
          or as adventurous as going to an <a href="https://www.sfspca.org/behavior-training/dog-training/sports/introduction-agility">
            agility course</a>.
          Or share the joy your dog brings you with others by volunteering together
          through a <a href="https://www.sfspca.org/get-involved/volunteer/animal-asst-therapy/become-aat-volunteer">
            therapy dog program</a>.
          Whatever you end up choosing, always remember to be just as much of a best
          friend to your dog as he or she is to you.<br><br>
          That's all we have for now! It's such a joy to bring a dog into your life.
          Watson has become an integral part of our family, and we can't wait to see
          how your dog becomes a part of yours.
